1. AlphaFold: Developed by DeepMind, AlphaFold is a deep learning system that predicts protein structures with high accuracy. This breakthrough could revolutionize drug discovery and our understanding of biological systems.

2. GPT-3: Created by OpenAI, GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a powerful language model capable of generating human-like text. It has been used for various applications, including content creation, translation, and summarization.

3. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training): Developed by OpenAI, CLIP is a model that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. It can associate images with relevant text descriptions, enabling better image recognition and search capabilities.

4. DALL-E: Also from OpenAI, DALL-E is a model that generates images from textual descriptions. It combines the capabilities of CLIP and
